## PriceIsRight

This program is a game, where you are supposed to guess the number that the program comes up with. As you complete more
and more games, your experience level and points increase. Based on your points, the program will increase the range of
the number in each game.

## Turtles

This program reads in a number between 1 and 90 (n). Using that number, it creates a pattern using Turtle. Each pattern
is
an equiangular spiral, and the greater the inputted number is, the closer it is to becoming a perfect spiral. The angle
is the interior angle of a regular polygon with n sides.
